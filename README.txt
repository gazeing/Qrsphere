Now this is the demo and framework of Qrsphere, a qrcode scan and republish tool app on Android. I'm using ZXING library for decoding the qrcode to stream.

Google maps library ("windows-User"\android-sdks\extras\google\google_play_services\libproject\google-play-services_lib) need to be copied to the same path of the project and added to your IDE in order to pass run-time examination.
