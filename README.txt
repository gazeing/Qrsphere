Now this is the demo and framework of Qrsphere, a qrcode scan and republish tool app on Android. I'm using ZXING library for decoding the qrcode to stream.

Google maps ("windows-User"\android-sdks\extras\google\google_play_services\libproject\google-play-services_lib) library need to be copy to the same path of the project in order to compile it.
